Welcome to the official documentation of Papra, an intuitive open-source document management and archiving platform. It is designed to be simple to use and accessible to everyone. Papra is a plateform for long-term document storage and management, like a digital archive for your documents.

Papra can be used in two different ways:

- As a **self-hosted solution**, using the fully packaged lightweight [Docker image](/self-hosting/using-docker).
- As a **fully managed solution**, using our cloud service available on [papra.app](https://papra.app).
